# Env-Snapper TODO List

This document outlines potential improvements, new features, bug fixes, and other enhancements for the env-snapper project. The goal is to make the tool more robust, user-friendly, and feature-rich while maintaining its core functionality of managing environment variable snapshots.

### Core Functionality Enhancements
- **Multi-file Support Expansion**: Add support for additional environment file formats (e.g., `.env.production`, `.env.development`, YAML-based env files).
- **Snapshot Merging**: Implement ability to merge multiple snapshots into one, useful for combining configurations from different branches or environments.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Add interactive conflict resolution when reverting snapshots that might overwrite current changes.
- **Branch-specific Snapshots**: Allow tagging or associating snapshots with specific git branches for better organization in multi-branch projects.
- **Template System**: Create snapshot templates for common configurations (e.g., dev, staging, production) that can be applied or referenced.

### User Interface & Experience
- **Web-based Dashboard**: Develop a simple web UI for managing snapshots, viewing diffs, and performing operations without CLI commands.
- **Interactive CLI Prompts**: Enhance CLI with interactive prompts for better user guidance (e.g., using inquirer.js for selections).
- **Rich Terminal Output**: Improve output formatting with better colors, tables, and progress bars for list and diff commands.

### Integration & Extensibility
- **IDE Extensions**: Create official VS Code or other IDE extensions for seamless integration.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Add hooks or plugins for automatic snapshot creation in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
- **Cloud Storage Support**: Integrate with cloud storage services (AWS S3, Google Cloud, Azure) for storing snapshots remotely.
- **Team Collaboration Features**: Add user authentication and sharing capabilities for team environments.
- **API Endpoints**: Expose a REST API for programmatic access to snapshot operations.

### Advanced Features
- **Snapshot Search**: Implement full-text search within snapshot contents and metadata.
- **Snapshot Analytics**: Enhanced analytics with graphs and trends for environment variable changes over time.
- **Automated Backup Scheduling**: Add cron-like scheduling for automatic snapshots at specified intervals.
- **Environment Validation**: Validate .env files for syntax errors or missing variables before snapshotting.
- **Snapshot Dependencies**: Track dependencies between environment variables and warn about potential issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading for Large Snapshots**: Implement lazy loading for diff operations on large snapshot histories.
- **Database Backend**: Migrate from file-based storage to a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) for better query performance.
- **Caching Enhancements**: Improve caching mechanisms for faster list and search operations.
- **Parallel Processing**: Use parallel processing for export/import operations to handle large snapshot sets.

### Usability Enhancements
- **Better Error Messages**: Provide more descriptive and actionable error messages with suggestions.
- **Command Autocomplete**: Add shell autocompletion for CLI commands and options.
- **Configuration Wizard**: Create an interactive setup wizard for initial configuration.
- **Help System**: Enhance built-in help with examples, use cases, and troubleshooting guides.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations in interactive modes.

### Security Improvements
- **Key Management**: Implement secure key management for encryption keys (e.g., using system keychains).
- **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive audit logs for all snapshot operations.
- **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access for multi-user scenarios.
- **Secure Defaults**: Review and improve default security settings.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Known Issues
- **Large File Handling**: Fix potential memory issues when handling very large .env files.
- **Encoding Issues**: Address encoding problems with non-UTF-8 environment files.
- **Git Integration Edge Cases**: Handle edge cases in git operations (e.g., merge conflicts, detached HEAD state).
- **Plugin Loading Errors**: Improve error handling for plugin loading and execution.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Ensure consistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Testing & Validation
- **Input Validation**: Strengthen validation for user inputs (e.g., snapshot IDs, file paths).
- **Error Recovery**: Improve recovery from interrupted operations (e.g., partial exports).

## üìö Documentation

### Updates Needed
- **API Documentation**: Document all CLI commands, options, and configuration parameters.
- **Tutorials & Guides**: Create step-by-step tutorials for common use cases.
- **Migration Guides**: Provide guides for upgrading between major versions.
